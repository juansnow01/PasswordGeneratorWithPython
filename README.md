# Password Generator with Python
Python random PW Generator
# New Repo Alert!!!

Learning python and I was reading on twitter and also getting advice from a close friend (S/O [@MartyCodes](https://twitter.com/martycodes)) that learning while building is the best way to accelerate progess and understanding. A couple of minutes on google got me to a page where you can interactively learn Python by building some stuff, and a random PW generator is one of those things.

It sounded daunting at first but once I got my hands dirty it was up. Now here it is in all its glory...

If you see anything wrong with it or know how I can imporve it please let me know.
